# ECC's installer overwrites ~/.codex/AGENTS.md and ~/.opencode/AGENTS.md, which are the
# files setup-user appends the team conventions to — and for Codex that append is the ONLY
# route those conventions arrive by, since Codex has no rules layer. So an install silently
# undid setup-user. --restore puts it back, and does nothing at all if setup-user has never
# been run here (it keys off a stamp file, so a first install still turns nothing on).
#
# --enable-hooks is required from upstream 2.2.1 onward: the installer refuses to write the
# hook runtime without an explicit yes. It copies the hook scripts AND, unlike 2.1.0, wires
# its whole registry into ~/.claude/settings.json — upstream's fix for "hooks are installed
# but not wired" in UPSTREAM.md. On the 2026-09-12 bump that took us from 2 wired matchers
# to 27 without anyone asking for it.
#
# We keep --enable-hooks so the scripts land (--no-hooks would remove block-no-verify and
# config-protection with them), and `setup-user.py` then resets the "hooks" key to just
# those two. Read setup_hooks() before changing either half; they are one decision.
